# Decentralized-Voting

This repository hosts a decentralized voting application that leverages blockchain technology to ensure secure, transparent, and tamper-proof voting. The project demonstrates how smart contracts can be used to record votes for political parties on the blockchain, integrating modern web3 practices with a user-friendly React interface.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **ethers.js**: To interact with the Ethereum blockchain and execute smart contract functions.
- **Solidity**: For writing and deploying the smart contract that manages the voting logic.
- **MetaMask**: For user authentication and secure transaction signing.
- **Blockchain (Ethereum)**: To provide a decentralized and secure ledger for recording votes.

## Overview

The application allows users to connect their MetaMask wallet, cast their vote, and have their vote securely recorded on the Ethereum blockchain. Each political party is represented with a name and logo, ensuring that voters have a clear and engaging interface.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- MetaMask extension installed in your browser.
- An Ethereum test network account (e.g., using Ropsten, Rinkeby, or another testnet).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Decentralized-Voting.git

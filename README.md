# Decentralized-Voting
This repository hosts a decentralized voting application that leverages blockchain technology to ensure secure, transparent, and tamper-proof voting. The project demonstrates how smart contracts can be used to record votes for political parties on the blockchain, integrating modern web3 practices with a user-friendly React interface.

**Technologies Used**
React: For building the dynamic and responsive user interface.
ethers.js: To interact with the Ethereum blockchain and execute smart contract functions.
Solidity: For writing and deploying the smart contract that manages the voting logic.
MetaMask: For user authentication and secure transaction signing.
Blockchain (Ethereum): To provide a decentralized and secure ledger for recording votes.
